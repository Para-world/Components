## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Para-world/Components
   cd Components

Install dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

Set up the environment:

Create a .env file in the /backend directory with the following keys:
makefile
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string


Start the backend server:
node app.js

Open the form in your browser:

Navigate to the /frontend/index.html file.


üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Fill out the form fields and submit.
Enjoy the animations powered by GSAP as you interact with the form.
Data will be securely sent to the backend and stored in the MongoDB database.
You can extend the backend API to include additional operations (e.g., view, edit, delete form data).


üñåÔ∏è GSAP Animations
The GSAP animations bring the form to life with smooth transitions and dynamic effects. Below are some of the animations included:

Form Fade-In: The form fades into view when the page loads.
Input Field Highlighting: Inputs have hover and focus effects for better interactivity.
Submit Button Animation: The button features a hover effect with scaling and color transitions.
Feel free to explore and extend the animations in the gsap-animations.js file!


üåü Future Enhancements
Add server-side validation for better security.
Extend animations for better user feedback (e.g., form validation errors).
Implement authentication for accessing form data.
Create an admin panel for managing submissions.
Add support for file uploads (e.g., images, documents).
